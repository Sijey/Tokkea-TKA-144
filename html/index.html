            1) Please send <b>0.20748000</b> BTC to <b>39pNKwypSwkLLgVvncosRavWafzDWaMJJi</b>
            (Make sure that the amount sent is sufficient to cover the service fees!).
            You will have to initiate a payment using your software or online wallet,
            and copy / paste the address and the payment amount into it. We will send you an email
            when the funds are received. You have 2 hours, 46 minutes, 25 seconds left for us
            to receive verified funds. If you send us funds that are not confirmed on time,
            please contact us using the information below and CoinPayments.net will issue a refund.
            <br />
            i) Transaction ID: CPFH0QTMZV5HOBU4FTQLHM6UDH
            <br />
            ii) Payment address to which funds are to be transferred.
            <br />
            iii) This is the verification code:<br /> 62c05b6b2d4c9ef0285f747b6a1c3564
            (to confirm that you are the sender of the transaction).
            <br /><br />
            2) As soon as the payment is confirmed several times on the block chain,
            it will be completed and the seller will be notified. The confirmation
            process usually takes 30-45 minutes, but depends on the block time
            of the cryptocurrency and the required number of block confirmations.
            The status page will be available for the next 30 days.
